# Cosmac-VIP-Mega-Loader
Updated software for the ProjectVIP emulator.

Originally written by Paul Robsons paul@robsons.org.uk back in 2013 with Python 2 and Arduino 1.8 and modified by Walter Miraglia , the software needed to be upgraded to the latest versions of Python and Arduino.

It was essentially working but the python script was completely re-done keeping the data protocol intact. 

The arduino code needs to be placed in the Arduino projects folder under CosmacVIPMega.

At the time of writing, the Python version needs to be 3.12 with pyserial, click, time, and colorama installed using pip.
